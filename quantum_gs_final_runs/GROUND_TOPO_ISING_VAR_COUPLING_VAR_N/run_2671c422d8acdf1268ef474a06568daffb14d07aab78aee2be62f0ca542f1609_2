In my model calculations using H0 at \u03b1=0.5, I found some different results for N=3, which might not match because A=0 should indicate zero amplitude for three-body interactions.

However, I encountered an issue when trying to set the Hamiltonian because the variable A needs to be a constant in the simulation.
