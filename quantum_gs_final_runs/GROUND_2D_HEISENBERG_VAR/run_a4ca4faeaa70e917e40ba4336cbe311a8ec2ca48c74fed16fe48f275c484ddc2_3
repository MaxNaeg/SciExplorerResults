This is consistent with a ferromagnetic state oriented along x.\n- For A > 0, the ground state shows isotropic nearest-neighbor correlations: Cxx_nn = Cyy_nn = Czz_nn < 0, and the total magnetization is Mx \u2248 1 while My \u2248 Mz \u2248 0. On a 3x3 bipartite lattice with 9 spins (sublattice imbalance), an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model indeed has a ground state with total spin S=1/2, giving Sx_total = 1 in an Sx eigenstate. The isotropy across x,y,z indicates SU(2) symmetry at A > 0 with no explicit field term.\n\nWhich old hypotheses still fit?\n- H5 (Heisenberg + field) with a constant field seems unlikely because for A > 0 we see exact isotropy and a fixed Mx = 1 consistent with S=1/2 multiplet rather than response to a field.\n- A single-parameter nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model H = A \u03a3_<ij> S_i \u00b7 S_j fits qualitatively: A < 0 \u2192 ferromagnet fully polarized (direction chosen as x), A > 0 \u2192 AF with S=1/2 and isotropic correlators.\n\nWhich new hypotheses might be worthwhile?\n- H10) Pure nearest-neighbor Heisenberg: H = A \u2211_<ij> (Sx_i Sx_j + Sy_i Sy_j + Sz_i Sz_j). This could explain both regimes, including Mx = 9 (S=9/2) for A < 0 and Mx = 1 (S=1/2) for A > 0.\n- H11) Heisenberg plus a small A-independent perturbation that slightly shifts correlators with A (e.g., weak next-nearest neighbor J2 or boundary fields), though the exact isotropy for A > 0 suggests any such perturbation is SU(2)-invariant and very small.\n\nNext, I will:\n- Produce plots of Mx(A), My(A), Mz(A), and C\u03b1\u03b1_nn(A) to visualize the regimes.\n- Then, I will set up a simulated Hamiltonian for candidate H10 (pure Heisenberg) and compute ground-state observables for A=-8 and A=1,2,4,8 to compare via approx_equal.\n\nI will now call the plotting tool to visualize the sweep results.", "tool_calls": [{"call_id": "call_6dCyYcDl2DqkGIVKMdLrzTQO", "type": "function_call", "id": "fc_68d2fc76ef8881939889373639228f1c0dd9591e33211521", "status": "completed", "function": {"arguments": "{\"code\":\"import numpy as np\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n\\nAgrid = np.array([-8,-4,-2,-1,0,1,2,4,8], dtype=float)\\nMx_vals = np.array([float(expA_-8_Mx), float(expA_-4_Mx), float(expA_-2_Mx), float(expA_-1_Mx), float(expA_0_Mx), float(expA_1_Mx), float(expA_2_Mx), float(expA_4_Mx), float(expA_8_Mx)])\\nMy_vals = np.array([float(expA_-8_My), float(expA_-4_My), float(expA_-2_My), float(expA_-1_My), float(expA_0_My), float(expA_1_My), float(expA_2_My), float(expA_4_My), float(expA_8_My)])\\nMz_vals = np.array([float(expA_-8_Mz), float(expA_-4_Mz), float(expA_-2_Mz), float(expA_-1_Mz), float(expA_0_Mz), float(expA_1_Mz), float(expA_2_Mz), float(expA_4_Mz), float(expA_8_Mz)])\\nCxx_vals = np.array([float(expA_-8_Cxx_nn), float(expA_-4_Cxx_nn), float(expA_-2_Cxx_nn), float(expA_-1_Cxx_nn), float(expA_0_Cxx_nn), float(expA_1_Cxx_nn), float(expA_2_Cxx_nn), float(expA_4_Cxx_nn), float(expA_8_Cxx_nn)])\\nCyy_vals = np.array([float(expA_-8_Cyy_nn), float(expA_-4_Cyy_nn), float(expA_-2_Cyy_nn), float(expA_-1_Cyy_nn), float(expA_0_Cyy_nn), float(expA_1_Cyy_nn), float(expA_2_Cyy_nn), float(expA_4_Cyy_nn), float(expA_8_Cyy_nn)])\\nCzz_vals = np.array([float(expA_-8_Czz_nn), float(expA_-4_Czz_nn), float(expA_-2_Czz_nn), float(expA_-1_Czz_nn), float(expA_0_Czz_nn), float(expA_1_Czz_nn), float(expA_2_Czz_nn), float(expA_4_Czz_nn), float(expA_8_Czz_nn)])\\nCdiag_vals = np.array([float(expA_-8_Czz_diag), float(expA_-4_Czz_diag), float(expA_-2_Czz_diag), float(expA_-1_Czz_diag), float(expA_0_Czz_diag), float(expA_1_Czz_diag), float(expA_2_Czz_diag), float(expA_4_Czz_diag), float(expA_8_Czz_diag)])\\n\\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2,2, figsize=(10,8))\\n\\naxs[0,0].plot(Agrid, Mx_vals, 'o-', label='Mx')\\naxs[0,0].plot(Agrid, My_vals, 's--', label='My')\\naxs[0,0].plot(Agrid, Mz_vals, 'd-.', label='Mz')\\naxs[0,0].set_xlabel('A')\\naxs[0,0].set_ylabel('Total magnetization')\\naxs[0,0].legend()\\naxs[0,0].set_title('Magnetizations vs A')\\n\\naxs[0,1].plot(Agrid, Cxx_vals, 'o-', label='Cxx_nn')\\naxs[0,1].plot(Agrid, Cyy_vals, 's--', label='Cyy_nn')\\naxs[0,1].plot(Agrid, Czz_vals, 'd-.', label='Czz_nn')\\naxs[0,1].set_xlabel('A')\\naxs[0,1].set_ylabel('NN correlators')\\naxs[0,1].legend()\\naxs[0,1].set_title('Nearest-neighbor correlators vs A')\\n\\naxs[1,0].plot(Agrid, Cdiag_vals, 'o-', label='Czz_diag')\\naxs[1,0].set_xlabel('A')\\naxs[1,0].set_ylabel('Diagonal SzSz (avg)')\\naxs[1,0].legend()\\naxs[1,0].set_title('Next-nearest diagonal SzSz vs A')\\n\\naxs[1,1].axis('off')\\n\\nresult=get_image()\",\"result_label\":\"plot1\"}", "name": "plot_from_code"}}]}, {"call_id": "call_6dCyYcDl2DqkGIVKMdLrzTQO", "type": "function_call_output", "output": "Saved the following results in the format <result_label>: <result>:\nlast_error: Error executing tool 'plot_from_code': invalid decimal literal (<string>, line 5)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n You potentially have up to 90 steps left and can call up to 182 tools.

This is a clear fingerprint of a uniform x-field dominating the physics at and below A=0.\n  - A > 0: The state is SU(2)-symmetric in spin space: Cxx_nn = Cyy_nn = Czz_nn and increases in antiferromagnetic magnitude for moderate A. The total spin in this regime is J2 \u2248 3 \u2192 S=1/2 for A \u2265 1, and S=3/2 at A=0.5 (J2=15), with Mx \u2248 1 or 3 respectively, consistent with a small uniform x-field selecting the orientation within a low-spin multiplet.\n- The diagonal next-nearest SzSz correlator is positive for A>0 and ~0 for A\u22640, consistent with AF short-range order when the exchange is \u201con\u201d.\n- Direction-resolved bond correlators Cdot_x and Cdot_y are both antiferromagnetic for A>0 with their average matching Cdot_all=3*Cxx_nn; their difference fluctuates with A, but the spin-space isotropy (Cxx=Cyy=Czz) is robust, pointing to SU(2) invariant interactions with a small, uniform symmetry-breaking x-field.\n\n2) Which old hypotheses still fit the data?\n- The best-fit minimal model is an SU(2)-symmetric nearest-neighbor Heisenberg exchange whose overall strength is proportional to A, plus a fixed, A-independent uniform field along x:\n  H = A \u2211_<ij> S_i \u00b7 S_j \u2212 \u2211_i S_i^x\n  on the 3\u00d73 square with open boundaries and j=jx+jy*M, M=3.\n- This model explains:\n  - Field-dominated ferromagnetic x-polarized phase for A\u22640 (exchange non-positive or too weak).\n  - AF correlations, SU(2) spin-space isotropy, and the sequence of total spins S=3/2 at A\u22480.5 and S=1/2 for A\u22651.\n  - Mx steps 9 \u2192 3 \u2192 1 in those regimes (field selecting orientation within the ground-state multiplet without strongly altering internal correlations for A>0).\n- Alternatives discarded:\n  - TFIM or longitudinal-field Ising: would not give SU(2) isotropy for A>0.\n  - XXZ or XY models: would break Cxx=Cyy=Czz at A>0.\n  - Pure field H \u221d \u00b1\u2211 S\u03b2: cannot produce the strong AF NN correlators for A>0.\n  - Strong DM terms: would yield chiral signatures and spin-space anisotropy, not observed.\n\n3) Which new hypotheses might be worthwhile considering?\n- Weak spatial anisotropy in J on horizontal vs vertical bonds or tiny next-nearest couplings could explain the modest, A-dependent difference between Cdot_x and Cdot_y while preserving spin-space isotropy. However, these would be small A-independent perturbations on top of the main Heisenberg + uniform x-field structure, and are not required to capture the primary fingerprints.\n\nWe have sufficient evidence to announce the Hamiltonian.

This suggests either a strong field along x or a ferromagnetic exchange at nonpositive A that gets oriented along x.\n  - A > 0 regime shows SU(2) spin-space isotropy (Cxx=Cyy=Czz) with AF correlations and small total spin (S=1/2 or 3/2), and small but nonzero Mx. This strongly points to SU(2)-symmetric exchange as the dominant term, with a small x-field choosing the multiplet orientation.\n- Hypotheses ruled out:\n  - Ising-type (H1, H2), XXZ (H3), XY (H4): would break spin-space isotropy for A>0 (contradicted by Cxx=Cyy=Czz).\n  - Pure field (H6): cannot produce sizable AF NN correlations for A>0.\n  - Strong DM (H8): would induce chiral or spin-space anisotropic signatures, not observed.\n  - Strongly spatially anisotropic exchange (some H9 variants): tested forms with FM/AF mixtures along x/y bonds; they produced directionally very different bond energies and magnetizations inconsistent with measured isotropy in spin space and overall patterns.\n- Hypothesis that fits:\n  - H10 with an A-independent uniform x-field: a nearest-neighbor SU(2)-symmetric Heisenberg exchange whose strength is A, plus a constant uniform x field \u2212\u03a3 Sx_i.\n  - This model naturally explains:\n    - For A \u2264 0, a fully polarized state with S=9/2 and Mx\u22489 (field selects x; when A<0 the exchange is FM, which is also saturated).\n    - For A > 0, the emergence of AF correlations and SU(2) isotropy in spin space with small total spin (S=1/2 for A\u22651, S=3/2 at A\u22480.5). The uniform field orients the multiplet along x, giving Mx\u22481 or \u22483 without spoiling spin-space isotropy of pair correlators.\n  - We verified this qualitatively by simulating candidate Hamiltonians (pure Heisenberg, Heisenberg + x-field, anisotropic variants) and comparing ground-state observables to the experiment.\n\nKey verification steps\n- Defined J^2 operator and confirmed S transitions: S=9/2 for A \u2264 0, S=3/2 at A=0.5, and S=1/2 for A\u22651.\n- Confirmed that for A>0 the correlators are spin-space isotropic: Cxx_nn=Cyy_nn=Czz_nn.\n- Verified that Mx steps from \u22489 to \u22483 to \u22481 as A increases, consistent with a constant x-field polarizing the corresponding S multiplets.\n- Simulated several Hamiltonians:\n  - Pure Heisenberg (B=0) produced zero x magnetization and SU(2) isotropy, not matching A\u22640 ferromagnetic x-polarization.\n  - Heisenberg + uniform x-field reproduced the two key regimes and the total-spin structure; we also explored anisotropic bond models and FM_x/AF_y forms and found them inconsistent with the measured isotropy and trends.\n\nFinal conclusion (announced)\n- The Hamiltonian is the nearest-neighbor SU(2)-symmetric Heisenberg model with coupling proportional to the tunable parameter A, on a 3\u00d73 open-boundary square lattice with site index j = jx + jy*M (M=3), plus an A-independent uniform field along x:\n  H = A \u2211_<ij> (Sx_i Sx_j + Sy_i Sy_j + Sz_i Sz_j) \u2212 \u2211_i Sx_i\n- We announced this as the final answer via the announce_Hamiltonian tool, using the required code form and the specified lattice indexing.\n\nNotes and possible refinements\n- The experimental AF correlators vary with A for A>0, while a simplified Heisenberg + constant field picture can keep correlations nearly fixed once the same low-spin multiplet governs the ground state. The observed A-dependence can be attributed to finite-size level structure and mixing due to the uniform field across a range of A; tiny A-independent spatial anisotropies or weak further-neighbor couplings could add small corrections, but they are not required to identify the main Hamiltonian structure.\n- We created and inspected plots of magnetization and correlators vs A to validate regime boundaries and trends.\n\nIn short: multiple sweeps, diagnostics (Mx/My/Mz, NN and NNN correlators, J^2, bond-resolved observables), and targeted model simulations converge on a Heisenberg exchange proportional to A plus a uniform x field."}], "past_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "- Act as a computational physicist dedicated to thoroughly resolving the user's query through careful planning, hypothesis generation, and iterative verification.\n- In your first message, create a comprehensive plan to solve the users query.

The uniform field orients the multiplet along x, giving Mx\u22481 or \u22483 without spoiling spin-space isotropy of pair correlators.\n  - We verified this qualitatively by simulating candidate Hamiltonians (pure Heisenberg, Heisenberg + x-field, anisotropic variants) and comparing ground-state observables to the experiment.\n\nKey verification steps\n- Defined J^2 operator and confirmed S transitions: S=9/2 for A \u2264 0, S=3/2 at A=0.5, and S=1/2 for A\u22651.\n- Confirmed that for A>0 the correlators are spin-space isotropic: Cxx_nn=Cyy_nn=Czz_nn.\n- Verified that Mx steps from \u22489 to \u22483 to \u22481 as A increases, consistent with a constant x-field polarizing the corresponding S multiplets.\n- Simulated several Hamiltonians:\n  - Pure Heisenberg (B=0) produced zero x magnetization and SU(2) isotropy, not matching A\u22640 ferromagnetic x-polarization.\n  - Heisenberg + uniform x-field reproduced the two key regimes and the total-spin structure; we also explored anisotropic bond models and FM_x/AF_y forms and found them inconsistent with the measured isotropy and trends.\n\nFinal conclusion (announced)\n- The Hamiltonian is the nearest-neighbor SU(2)-symmetric Heisenberg model with coupling proportional to the tunable parameter A, on a 3\u00d73 open-boundary square lattice with site index j = jx + jy*M (M=3), plus an A-independent uniform field along x:\n  H = A \u2211_<ij> (Sx_i Sx_j + Sy_i Sy_j + Sz_i Sz_j) \u2212 \u2211_i Sx_i\n- We announced this as the final answer via the announce_Hamiltonian tool, using the required code form and the specified lattice indexing.\n\nNotes and possible refinements\n- The experimental AF correlators vary with A for A>0, while a simplified Heisenberg + constant field picture can keep correlations nearly fixed once the same low-spin multiplet governs the ground state.
