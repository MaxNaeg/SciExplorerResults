Then compute approximate accelerations ddot q from time-differences of velocities.\n- Fit the candidate models to the computed accelerations via linear or nonlinear least squares to extract parameters (e.g., masses, damping, stiffness, cross-couplings).\n- Compare models by residuals and by their ability to predict held-out portions of the data.\n- If a simple linear model explains data well (e.g., H3/H4 with a small set of parameters), prefer it for interpretability. If residuals show velocity-dependent or nonlinear trends, consider nonlinear/dissipative terms (H7/H8/H11).\n- Qualitatively examine energy-like quantity E = 0.5 m (q0_dot^2 + q1_dot^2) + V(q0, q1) for damping or driving.\n\n4) Numerical parameter estimation strategy\n- For a general linear second-order model with cross-terms (H4 or H9), solve for parameters by stacking equations for each time step: ddot_q = A [q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot]^T plus constant biases if needed.\n- Use least squares with regularization if needed to avoid overfitting.\n- Evaluate parameter confidence by bootstrap or cross-validation across the time series.\n\n5) Visualization plan\n- Plot trajectories q0(t) and q1(t) for all 5 evolutions on the same axes to compare trajectories.\n- Plot velocities q0_dot(t), q1_dot(t) likewise.\n- Plot accelerations ddot_q0(t), ddot_q1(t) (estimated from data) vs model-predicted accelerations for best-fitting models.\n- Plot phase portraits (q0 vs q0_dot, q1 vs q1_dot) colored by experiment.\n\n6) Next steps after initial fitting\n- If a single-model family emerges as best-fit (e.g., damped decoupled harmonic oscillators with small cross-terms), refine parameter estimates and test predictive power on extra initial-condition experiments (not used in fitting).\n- If multiple models fit similarly, design additional targeted experiments (e.g., purposely excite cross-coupled modes or drive with external forcing) to break degeneracy.\n\n7) Finalization plan\n- Once a robust, physically interpretable EOM is identified with plausible parameter values, provide the final equations of motion in standard form and present the numerical parameter values, with one or two alternative models if ambiguity remains.\n- Conclude with a final rhs function implementing the preferred model for use in simulations or further analysis, and submit that via the save_result_find_eom tool.\n\nProceeding to run the initial 5-evolution experiment to begin data-driven inference.

Generate accelerations (ddot) from observed positions/velocities, fit linear (and later nonlinear) models ddot = F(q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot), assess fit quality, and refine hypotheses. Save the final, usable model for simulation.\n\n2) Data collected and initial hypotheses\n- Data sources:\n  - Mystery data set 1: mystery_evols (5 evolutions, each with 20001 time steps, and fields [q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot]).\n  - Additional experiments E6\u2013E10: mystery_evols_E6 to mystery_evols_E10 (each with its own time steps and 4-state data). These were added to enrich the dataset.\n- Qualitative hypotheses (an extensive candidate list was created). Examples include:\n  - H0: Free inertial motion (ddot_q0 = 0, ddot_q1 = 0)\n  - H1: Linear damping (ddot proportional to velocity components)\n  - H2: Linear springs to origin (ddot proportional to -q)\n  - H3/H4: Dampened springs with possible cross-terms\n  - H5: Coriolis-like coupling (gyroscopic cross-coupling, ddot ~ cross-velocity)\n  - H6: Constant external forcing (bias)\n  - H7/H8: Nonlinearities (cubic springs, quadratic/velocity-dependent drag)\n  - H11: Energy-like model with potential and dissipation forms\n  - H12: Piecewise/regime-switching dynamics\n\n3) Data processing and initial modeling attempts\n- Step: Estimate accelerations ddot by differentiating velocities with respect to time (nonuniform time grids). Used central differences where appropriate and edge/forward approximations at boundaries.\n- First regression attempt (linear, with 4 state terms):\n  - Model form: ddot0 \u2248 a0*q0 + a1*q1 + a2*q0_dot + a3*q1_dot, ddot1 \u2248 b0*q0 + b1*q1 + b2*q0_dot + b3*q1_dot\n  - Methods: Ordinary least squares, with ridge/regularization in later attempts to stabilize ill-conditioning.\n  - Data handling: Used interior points (excluding boundaries) from all evolutions; included a small intercept/constant term in the design in some attempts, but the final \u201cfinal\u201d EOM uses no explicit intercept.\n  - Results (summary from robust attempts):\n    - Coefficients (final robust fit used for the saved model):\n      - ddot q0 = a0*q0 + a1*q1 + a2*q0_dot + a3*q1_dot\n        a0 = 0.04558558\n        a1 = 2.25576699\n        a2 = 3.74876166\n        a3 = 0.05725836\n      - ddot q1 = b0*q0 + b1*q1 + b2*q0_dot + b3*q1_dot\n        b0 = -0.16106601\n        b1 = -4.57669689\n        b2 = -0.71405056\n        b3 = 0.31058006\n    - Quality: R^2 values were modest (R2_0 \u2248 0.0415, R2_1 \u2248 0.0726 in earlier robust fits). This indicates the linear, four-term model explains only a small fraction of the observed accelerations, suggesting missing dynamics (nonlinearities, cross-terms, regime changes, or measurement noise).\n  - Cross-checks: Computed simple correlations between accelerations (ddot) and velocities to assess potential cross-coupling; found weak to modest correlations (e.g., |corr(ddot0, q1_dot)| \u2248 0.14; |corr(ddot1, q0_dot)| \u2248 -0.256). This supported the idea that the dynamics are not strongly explained by a simple decoupled linear model.\n\n- Additional attempts to improve the model:\n  - Expanded feature set with cross terms (q0*q1, q0^2, q1^2, q0*q0_dot, q0*q1_dot, q1*q0_dot, q1*q1_dot, q0_dot^2, q1_dot^2) and ridge regression. Goal: capture cross-couplings and basic nonlinearities.\n  - Challenges: Some runs timed out due to the size of the dataset and complexity of polynomial feature expansions; numerically, trying to robustly fit high-dimensional models against potential noise can be difficult.\n  - Result: Still no dramatically better fit using the expanded polynomial feature set from the initial runs; the R^2 values remained modest in subsequent attempts.\n\n4) Additional experiments and data fusion\n- Added another batch of evolutions (E6\u2013E10) to increase the diversity of initial conditions and dynamical regimes.\n- Per-evolution ddot estimates were recomputed, and a larger regression dataset was assembled by combining interior points across all evolutions.\n- A more robust ridge regression approach was attempted to stabilize the coefficients in the presence of noise and potential multicollinearity of the features.\n- Outcome: While the regression yielded a numerical set of coefficients, the explanatory power remained limited (R^2 values remained small), reinforcing the impression that a simple linear-in-state model is insufficient to fully capture the dynamics.\n\n5) Specific diagnostic result: cross-correlation analysis\n- You asked for a cross-correlation diagnostic to assess coupling structures.\n- Key findings:\n  - Corr(ddot0, q1_dot) \u2248 0.139\n  - Corr(ddot0, q0_dot) \u2248 0.069\n  - Corr(ddot1, q0_dot) \u2248 -0.256\n  - Corr(ddot1, q1_dot) \u2248 0.005\n- Interpretation: There is some mild correlation between accelerations and velocities indicating cross-coupled dynamics, but correlations are not strong enough to justify a simple, clean linear-parameter model with high predictive power. This supports exploring nonlinearities, cross-terms, or regime-switching dynamics (H7/H8/H11/H12 in the original hypothesis list).\n\n6) Final saved model (the outcome)\n- After iterative experimentation, a final explicit right-hand-side function (the EOM) was saved via the save_result_find_eom tool. The function is intended to be used by a solver as:\n  - State vector X = [q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot]\n  - ddot0 = a0*q0 + a1*q1 + a2*q0_dot + a3*q1_dot\n  - ddot1 = b0*q0 + b1*q1 + b2*q0_dot + b3*q1_dot\n  - Coefficients used:\n    - a0 = 0.04558558\n    - a1 = 2.25576699\n    - a2 = 3.74876166\n    - a3 = 0.05725836\n    - b0 = -0.16106601\n    - b1 = -4.57669689\n    - b2 = -0.71405056\n    - b3 = 0.31058006\n- Important note: This final EOM is a linear-in-state predictor derived from regression on the observed data. Its R^2 values were modest, indicating limited explanatory power for the entire dataset; the model should be treated as a data-informed, qualitative-to-semis quantitative approximation rather than a definitive physical model. It is a useful starting point for simulations and further hypothesis testing, but not a unique or guaranteed correct physical description.\n\n7) Final equations (explicitly)\n- In concise form, with q = [q0, q1]^T and q_dot = [q0_dot, q1_dot]^T, the identified model is:\n  - ddot q0 = a0*q0 + a1*q1 + a2*q0_dot + a3*q1_dot\n             = 0.04558558*q0 + 2.25576699*q1 + 3.74876166*q0_dot + 0.05725836*q1_dot\n  - ddot q1 = b0*q0 + b1*q1 + b2*q0_dot + b3*q1_dot\n             = -0.16106601*q0 - 4.57669689*q1 - 0.71405056*q0_dot + 0.31058006*q1_dot\n- This corresponds to the final saved rhs function (using the same four-state inputs) implemented in a JAX-friendly form (as provided in the final tool call).\n\n8) What can you learn from the results?\n- The data contain cross-coupled dynamics between q0, q1, q0_dot, and q1_dot, but a simple linear-in-state model explains only a small portion of the observed accelerations (low R^2 values). This suggests:\n  - There might be important nonlinearities (cubic stiffness, velocity-squared drag, etc.).\n  - Possible regime-switching or time-varying parameters that a single fixed linear model cannot capture.\n  - Measurement noise or unmodeled environmental influences could be substantial.\n- The chosen final EOM provides a compact, implementable, and data-informed baseline model that can be used for quick simulations and hypothesis testing, but it should be treated with caution given its limited explanatory power.\n\n9) Which old hypotheses still fit, and which new hypotheses are worth considering?\n- Still-worth testing:\n  - H5 (Coriolis-like coupling) and H4/H9 (cross-terms) are partially supported by observed cross-couplings, but not strongly enough to justify a fully linear cross-coupled model as the sole descriptor.\n  - H1/H3 (damping and springs) may be partially present but are not well captured by the obtained coefficients in a purely linear form.\n- New or refined hypotheses to consider:\n  - Nonlinear stiffness: include -k1*q0 - k2*q0^3 and similar for q1 to capture potential nonlinearity at larger amplitudes (H7/H11).\n  - Quadratic/velocity-dependent damping: include terms like -\u03b1*q0_dot*|q0_dot| or -\u03b2*q1_dot*|q1_dot| (H8).\n  - Cross-velocity drag or cross-coupled damping: terms like -\u03b3*q1_dot*(q0_dot) or -\u03b4*q0_dot*(q1_dot) (nonlinear cross terms).\n  - Gyroscopic-like terms with velocity cross-coupling, e.g., ddot0 \u221d q1_dot^2 or q0_dot^2, i.e., velocity-squared couplings.\n  - Piecewise/regime-switching dynamics: model parameters that switch with large amplitudes or high speeds (H12).\n  - Energy-based (potential + dissipation) form: explicitly derive V(q0, q1) and D(q0_dot, q1_dot) and fit a structured Lagrangian-based model (H11) to enforce physical constraints (conservation/dissipation structure).\n\n10) Next steps I would propose (if you want me to continue)\n- Collect more diverse experiments focusing on:\n  - Higher amplitude excitations to probe nonlinear stiffness and nonlinear damping.\n  - External forcing scenarios to identify driving terms.\n  - Regime-switching tests (e.g., thresholds in velocity or displacement).\n- Try a structured nonlinear model, e.g.:\n  - ddot q = K1 [q0, q1] + K2 [q0_dot, q1_dot] + K3 [q0^2, q1^2, q0*q1] + K4 [q0_dot^2, q1_dot^2] + cross terms like q0*q0_dot, q1*q1_dot, etc.\n  - Fit using regularized nonlinear least squares or sparse regression to promote physical interpretability (e.g., group Lasso to identify a small subset of active terms).\n- Explore a differential-algebraic or parametric model with time-varying parameters if needed.\n- Validate the model by out-of-sample prediction tests and by simulating responses to controlled inputs (driving forces, pulses, etc.).\n\n11) Final note\n- The final EOM (a0, a1, a2, a3, b0, b1, b2, b3) is now saved as the recommended starting point for simulations. If you\u2019d like, I can provide a small code snippet showing how to implement the final rhs in a simple ODE solver (or wrap it into a function compatible with your existing simulation framework).\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Produce a compact, ready-to-run Python snippet implementing the final EOM for numerical integration?\n- Propose and test a new nonlinear model (e.g., include q0^2, q1^2, q0^3, velocity-squared drag) and rerun a quick regression to see if the fit improves?"}], "past_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "- Act as a computational physicist dedicated to thoroughly resolving the user's query through careful planning, hypothesis generation, and iterative verification.\n- In your first message, create a comprehensive plan to solve the users query.

Generate accelerations (ddot) from observed positions/velocities, fit linear (and later nonlinear) models ddot = F(q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot), assess fit quality, and refine hypotheses. Save the final, usable model for simulation.\n\n2) Data collected and initial hypotheses\n- Data sources:\n  - Mystery data set 1: mystery_evols (5 evolutions, each with 20001 time steps, and fields [q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot]).\n  - Additional experiments E6\u2013E10: mystery_evols_E6 to mystery_evols_E10 (each with its own time steps and 4-state data). These were added to enrich the dataset.\n- Qualitative hypotheses (an extensive candidate list was created). Examples include:\n  - H0: Free inertial motion (ddot_q0 = 0, ddot_q1 = 0)\n  - H1: Linear damping (ddot proportional to velocity components)\n  - H2: Linear springs to origin (ddot proportional to -q)\n  - H3/H4: Dampened springs with possible cross-terms\n  - H5: Coriolis-like coupling (gyroscopic cross-coupling, ddot ~ cross-velocity)\n  - H6: Constant external forcing (bias)\n  - H7/H8: Nonlinearities (cubic springs, quadratic/velocity-dependent drag)\n  - H11: Energy-like model with potential and dissipation forms\n  - H12: Piecewise/regime-switching dynamics\n\n3) Data processing and initial modeling attempts\n- Step: Estimate accelerations ddot by differentiating velocities with respect to time (nonuniform time grids). Used central differences where appropriate and edge/forward approximations at boundaries.\n- First regression attempt (linear, with 4 state terms):\n  - Model form: ddot0 \u2248 a0*q0 + a1*q1 + a2*q0_dot + a3*q1_dot, ddot1 \u2248 b0*q0 + b1*q1 + b2*q0_dot + b3*q1_dot\n  - Methods: Ordinary least squares, with ridge/regularization in later attempts to stabilize ill-conditioning.\n  - Data handling: Used interior points (excluding boundaries) from all evolutions; included a small intercept/constant term in the design in some attempts, but the final \u201cfinal\u201d EOM uses no explicit intercept.\n  - Results (summary from robust attempts):\n    - Coefficients (final robust fit used for the saved model):\n      - ddot q0 = a0*q0 + a1*q1 + a2*q0_dot + a3*q1_dot\n        a0 = 0.04558558\n        a1 = 2.25576699\n        a2 = 3.74876166\n        a3 = 0.05725836\n      - ddot q1 = b0*q0 + b1*q1 + b2*q0_dot + b3*q1_dot\n        b0 = -0.16106601\n        b1 = -4.57669689\n        b2 = -0.71405056\n        b3 = 0.31058006\n    - Quality: R^2 values were modest (R2_0 \u2248 0.0415, R2_1 \u2248 0.0726 in earlier robust fits). This indicates the linear, four-term model explains only a small fraction of the observed accelerations, suggesting missing dynamics (nonlinearities, cross-terms, regime changes, or measurement noise).\n  - Cross-checks: Computed simple correlations between accelerations (ddot) and velocities to assess potential cross-coupling; found weak to modest correlations (e.g., |corr(ddot0, q1_dot)| \u2248 0.14; |corr(ddot1, q0_dot)| \u2248 -0.256). This supported the idea that the dynamics are not strongly explained by a simple decoupled linear model.\n\n- Additional attempts to improve the model:\n  - Expanded feature set with cross terms (q0*q1, q0^2, q1^2, q0*q0_dot, q0*q1_dot, q1*q0_dot, q1*q1_dot, q0_dot^2, q1_dot^2) and ridge regression. Goal: capture cross-couplings and basic nonlinearities.\n  - Challenges: Some runs timed out due to the size of the dataset and complexity of polynomial feature expansions; numerically, trying to robustly fit high-dimensional models against potential noise can be difficult.\n  - Result: Still no dramatically better fit using the expanded polynomial feature set from the initial runs; the R^2 values remained modest in subsequent attempts.\n\n4) Additional experiments and data fusion\n- Added another batch of evolutions (E6\u2013E10) to increase the diversity of initial conditions and dynamical regimes.\n- Per-evolution ddot estimates were recomputed, and a larger regression dataset was assembled by combining interior points across all evolutions.\n- A more robust ridge regression approach was attempted to stabilize the coefficients in the presence of noise and potential multicollinearity of the features.\n- Outcome: While the regression yielded a numerical set of coefficients, the explanatory power remained limited (R^2 values remained small), reinforcing the impression that a simple linear-in-state model is insufficient to fully capture the dynamics.\n\n5) Specific diagnostic result: cross-correlation analysis\n- You asked for a cross-correlation diagnostic to assess coupling structures.\n- Key findings:\n  - Corr(ddot0, q1_dot) \u2248 0.139\n  - Corr(ddot0, q0_dot) \u2248 0.069\n  - Corr(ddot1, q0_dot) \u2248 -0.256\n  - Corr(ddot1, q1_dot) \u2248 0.005\n- Interpretation: There is some mild correlation between accelerations and velocities indicating cross-coupled dynamics, but correlations are not strong enough to justify a simple, clean linear-parameter model with high predictive power. This supports exploring nonlinearities, cross-terms, or regime-switching dynamics (H7/H8/H11/H12 in the original hypothesis list).\n\n6) Final saved model (the outcome)\n- After iterative experimentation, a final explicit right-hand-side function (the EOM) was saved via the save_result_find_eom tool. The function is intended to be used by a solver as:\n  - State vector X = [q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot]\n  - ddot0 = a0*q0 + a1*q1 + a2*q0_dot + a3*q1_dot\n  - ddot1 = b0*q0 + b1*q1 + b2*q0_dot + b3*q1_dot\n  - Coefficients used:\n    - a0 = 0.04558558\n    - a1 = 2.25576699\n    - a2 = 3.74876166\n    - a3 = 0.05725836\n    - b0 = -0.16106601\n    - b1 = -4.57669689\n    - b2 = -0.71405056\n    - b3 = 0.31058006\n- Important note: This final EOM is a linear-in-state predictor derived from regression on the observed data. Its R^2 values were modest, indicating limited explanatory power for the entire dataset; the model should be treated as a data-informed, qualitative-to-semis quantitative approximation rather than a definitive physical model. It is a useful starting point for simulations and further hypothesis testing, but not a unique or guaranteed correct physical description.\n\n7) Final equations (explicitly)\n- In concise form, with q = [q0, q1]^T and q_dot = [q0_dot, q1_dot]^T, the identified model is:\n  - ddot q0 = a0*q0 + a1*q1 + a2*q0_dot + a3*q1_dot\n             = 0.04558558*q0 + 2.25576699*q1 + 3.74876166*q0_dot + 0.05725836*q1_dot\n  - ddot q1 = b0*q0 + b1*q1 + b2*q0_dot + b3*q1_dot\n             = -0.16106601*q0 - 4.57669689*q1 - 0.71405056*q0_dot + 0.31058006*q1_dot\n- This corresponds to the final saved rhs function (using the same four-state inputs) implemented in a JAX-friendly form (as provided in the final tool call).\n\n8) What can you learn from the results?\n- The data contain cross-coupled dynamics between q0, q1, q0_dot, and q1_dot, but a simple linear-in-state model explains only a small portion of the observed accelerations (low R^2 values). This suggests:\n  - There might be important nonlinearities (cubic stiffness, velocity-squared drag, etc.).\n  - Possible regime-switching or time-varying parameters that a single fixed linear model cannot capture.\n  - Measurement noise or unmodeled environmental influences could be substantial.\n- The chosen final EOM provides a compact, implementable, and data-informed baseline model that can be used for quick simulations and hypothesis testing, but it should be treated with caution given its limited explanatory power.\n\n9) Which old hypotheses still fit, and which new hypotheses are worth considering?\n- Still-worth testing:\n  - H5 (Coriolis-like coupling) and H4/H9 (cross-terms) are partially supported by observed cross-couplings, but not strongly enough to justify a fully linear cross-coupled model as the sole descriptor.\n  - H1/H3 (damping and springs) may be partially present but are not well captured by the obtained coefficients in a purely linear form.\n- New or refined hypotheses to consider:\n  - Nonlinear stiffness: include -k1*q0 - k2*q0^3 and similar for q1 to capture potential nonlinearity at larger amplitudes (H7/H11).\n  - Quadratic/velocity-dependent damping: include terms like -\u03b1*q0_dot*|q0_dot| or -\u03b2*q1_dot*|q1_dot| (H8).\n  - Cross-velocity drag or cross-coupled damping: terms like -\u03b3*q1_dot*(q0_dot) or -\u03b4*q0_dot*(q1_dot) (nonlinear cross terms).\n  - Gyroscopic-like terms with velocity cross-coupling, e.g., ddot0 \u221d q1_dot^2 or q0_dot^2, i.e., velocity-squared couplings.\n  - Piecewise/regime-switching dynamics: model parameters that switch with large amplitudes or high speeds (H12).\n  - Energy-based (potential + dissipation) form: explicitly derive V(q0, q1) and D(q0_dot, q1_dot) and fit a structured Lagrangian-based model (H11) to enforce physical constraints (conservation/dissipation structure).\n\n10) Next steps I would propose (if you want me to continue)\n- Collect more diverse experiments focusing on:\n  - Higher amplitude excitations to probe nonlinear stiffness and nonlinear damping.\n  - External forcing scenarios to identify driving terms.\n  - Regime-switching tests (e.g., thresholds in velocity or displacement).\n- Try a structured nonlinear model, e.g.:\n  - ddot q = K1 [q0, q1] + K2 [q0_dot, q1_dot] + K3 [q0^2, q1^2, q0*q1] + K4 [q0_dot^2, q1_dot^2] + cross terms like q0*q0_dot, q1*q1_dot, etc.\n  - Fit using regularized nonlinear least squares or sparse regression to promote physical interpretability (e.g., group Lasso to identify a small subset of active terms).\n- Explore a differential-algebraic or parametric model with time-varying parameters if needed.\n- Validate the model by out-of-sample prediction tests and by simulating responses to controlled inputs (driving forces, pulses, etc.).\n\n11) Final note\n- The final EOM (a0, a1, a2, a3, b0, b1, b2, b3) is now saved as the recommended starting point for simulations. If you\u2019d like, I can provide a small code snippet showing how to implement the final rhs in a simple ODE solver (or wrap it into a function compatible with your existing simulation framework).\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Produce a compact, ready-to-run Python snippet implementing the final EOM for numerical integration?\n- Propose and test a new nonlinear model (e.g., include q0^2, q1^2, q0^3, velocity-squared drag) and rerun a quick regression to see if the fit improves?", "type": "output_text", "logprobs": []}], "role": "assistant", "status": "completed", "type": "message"}], "result": {"R2": -0.811790943145752, "predicted_rhs": "import jax\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef rhs(X:jax.Array, t:float) -> jax.Array:\n    # Proposed final equations of motion (qualitative, with numerically fitted linear cross-coupled terms)\n    # State vector X = [q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot]\n    q0 = X[0]\n    q1 = X[1]\n    q0d = X[2]\n    q1d = X[3]\n    # Fitted coefficients (from robust linear-fit on expanded dataset; interpreted in m=1 units)\n    # These coefficients are obtained from a regression minimizing ddot on a mixture of linear terms; not guaranteed physically exact, but representative.\n    # ddot0 = a0*q0 + a1*q1 + a2*q0d + a3*q1d + a4  (optional intercept omitted here, see below)\n    a0 = 0.04558558\n    a1 = 2.25576699\n    a2 = 3.74876166\n    a3 = 0.05725836\n    # Coriolis-like/damping cross-coupling for ddot1\n    b0 = -0.16106601\n    b1 = -4.57669689\n    b2 = -0.71405056\n    b3 = 0.31058006\n\n    q0_dd = a0*q0 + a1*q1 + a2*q0d + a3*q1d\n    q1_dd = b0*q0 + b1*q1 + b2*q0d + b3*q1d\n\n    return jnp.array([q0d, q1d, q0_dd, q1_dd])\n", "R2_list": [1.0, 1.0, -0.7596945762634277, -4.48746919631958], "error": null}, "runtime": 751.6303651332855, "timestamp": "2025-09-22 14:29:03.692072", "input_hash": "2374d39e5b81924c9dac1ec0345c4deb0547668bd3b02f965da93495a8d33fa1"}
