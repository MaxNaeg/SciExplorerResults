Experimental plan (5+ experiments to span initial-condition space)\n- We will run 5 parallel evolutions (n_evolutions = 5) with diverse initial conditions to probe linearity, coupling, damping, and nonlinearity:\n  - Exp 1: q0(0)=1.0, q1(0)=0.0, q0dot(0)=0.0, q1dot(0)=0.0\n  - Exp 2: q0(0)=0.0, q1(0)=1.0, q0dot(0)=0.0, q1dot(0)=0.0\n  - Exp 3: q0(0)=1.0, q1(0)=1.0, q0dot(0)=0.0, q1dot(0)=0.0\n  - Exp 4: q0(0)=0.0, q1(0)=0.0, q0dot(0)=1.0, q1dot(0)=0.0\n  - Exp 5: q0(0)=-1.5, q1(0)=0.5, q0dot(0)=0.0, q1dot(0)=0.0\n\n- Data collection: For each evolution, collect time steps t and state vector [q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot] over a reasonably long window to observe damping, coupling exchange, and any nonlinear effects.\n\n- Baseline diagnostics to look for:\n  - If energy decays (damping present) vs. conserved energy (no damping)\n  - Presence of cross-energy transfer indicated by phase shifts and amplitude exchange between q0 and q1\n  - Nonlinear signatures (hardening/softening) via frequency shifts with amplitude\n  - Symmetry between the two coordinates (or lack thereof)\n\nIII. Data handling and visualization\n- Generate plots for each experiment:\n  - q0(t) and q1(t) vs t to inspect coupling and damping\n  - |q0| and |q1| envelopes to see energy exchange\n  - Phase-space plots (q0 vs q0_dot, q1 vs q1_dot) to assess linearity and damping\n  - Spectral content (FFT) to identify dominant frequencies and possible nonlinear harmonics\n\nIV. Model inference strategy\n- Start with the simplest hypothesis (H1/H3) and incrementally add coupling and nonlinearity (H2, H4-H6, etc.), guided by residuals between data and model predictions.\n- Parameter estimation: For each hypothesis, attempt to fit parameters (k0, k1, \u03b30, \u03b31, c, \u03b10, \u03b11, \u03bc, \u03bd, \u03b2, \u03b4, etc.) via least-squares on the observed acceleration data derived from trajectories, or use a black-box optimization on the differential equations to minimize trajectory mismatch.\n- Model selection criteria:\n  - Qualitative fit (does the model reproduce damping, coupling, energy transfer)\n  - Quantitative error (mean-squared error of state trajectories or accelerations)\n  - Parsimony (prefer simpler models if errors comparable)\n  - Predictive ability on held-out initial conditions (if we decide to hold out one initial condition for validation)\n\nV. Next steps after experiments\n- If a candidate EOM class consistently matches across the 5 experiments, refine parameter estimates with more precise optimization and test additional initial conditions (optional additional experiments).\n- If multiple models fit equally well, design targeted experiments to disambiguate (e.g., vary initial energy levels, probe nonlinear response by larger initial displacements).\n\nWhat I will do next\n- Run the 5-trajectory experiment set via the system tool, collect and plot the results, and begin qualitative comparison against the candidate hypotheses. Then I will report what new insights arise, which previous hypotheses remain viable, and what new hypotheses become worth testing. Finally, I will propose a concrete rhs(X, t) form (with estimated parameters) and, per your instruction, run save_result_find_eom to produce the final answer.", "tool_calls": [{"call_id": "call_eBVG5PZ3bqlzcjWavjrAsWJn", "type": "function_call", "id": "fc_68d14979abf88193b13657204bbc96c10a24e472b0bee4fe", "status": "completed", "function": {"arguments": "{\"q0_inits\":\"[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, -1.5]\",\"q1_inits\":\"[0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5]\",\"q0_dot_inits\":\"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]\",\"q1_dot_inits\":\"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\",\"result_label\":\"mystery_eom_experiments\"}", "name": "observe_multiple_evolutions"}}]}, {"call_id": "call_eBVG5PZ3bqlzcjWavjrAsWJn", "type": "function_call_output", "output": "Saved the following results in the format <result_label>: <result>:\nmystery_eom_experiments_tss: Array of shape (5, 20001) with dtype float32\nmystery_eom_experiments_arrays: Array of shape (5, 20001, 4) with dtype float32"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n You potentially have up to 59 steps left and can call up to 179 tools.

The final step is to present a concrete RHS function with numerical parameters.\n\n2) Candidate hypotheses considered\n- H1. Linear, uncoupled damped oscillators:\n  q0'' = -\u03b30 q0' - k0 q0\n  q1'' = -\u03b31 q1' - k1 q1\n- H2. Linear, damped with symmetric cross-coupling:\n  q0'' = -\u03b30 q0' - k0 q0 - c q1\n  q1'' = -\u03b31 q1' - k1 q1 - c q0\n- H3. Linear, conservative with coupling:\n  q0'' = -k0 q0 - c q1\n  q1'' = -k1 q1 - c q0\n- H4. Linear with Duffing-type (cubic) nonlinearities plus coupling:\n  q0'' = -k0 q0 - c q1 - \u03b10 q0^3\n  q1'' = -k1 q1 - c q0 - \u03b11 q1^3\n- H5/H6/H7/H8/H9/H10/etc. Various nonlinear damping, velocity-coupled damping, quadratic/cubic coupling, parametric drives, etc.\n- Takeaway: The family of models ranged from purely linear to moderately nonlinear, with several possible damping and cross-coupling mechanisms.\n\n3) Experimental plan and data collection\n- Five initial-condition experiments were planned per dataset and executed to span the space of initial displacements and velocities, including extreme cases.\n- Datasets:\n  - Mystery_eom_experiments (dataset 1): 5 evolutions with different initial q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot.\n  - Mystery_eom_experiments2 (dataset 2): another 5 evolutions with a different set of initial conditions.\n  - Mystery_eom_experiments3 (dataset 3): a third set of 5 evolutions.\n  - Mystery_eom_experiments4 (dataset 4): a fourth set of 5 evolutions.\n- Observables collected: Time series for q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot at many time steps (about 20001 per evolution in the first two datasets). The data structure for each run was [t, q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot].\n- Visualization: Plots were attempted to inspect q0(t), q1(t), velocities, and phase-space portraits, but some image outputs did not render in the interface (empty/blank images shown in the responses).\n\n4) Data processing and initial model fitting (dataset 2 focus)\n- Idea: Estimate q0'' and q1'' from observed data and regress them onto candidate right-hand sides using q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot.\n- Procedure (dataset 2):\n  - Compute accelerations q0'' and q1'' via finite differences of the velocity data (qd0, qd1) using central differences.\n  - Build regression data for q0'': q0'' \u2248 a0*q0 + b0*q1 + c0*q0' + d0*q1'\n  - Build regression data for q1'': q1'' \u2248 a1*q1 + b1*q0 + c1*q1' + d1*q0'\n  - Solve two separate least-squares problems to obtain coefficients.\n- Result (dataset 2):\n  - eq0 coefficients (for q0''):\n    a0 \u2248 -0.6852550019\n    b0 \u2248 0.2032296358\n    c0 \u2248 -0.2088563667\n    d0 \u2248 -0.0380717670\n  - eq1 coefficients (for q1''):\n    a1 \u2248 -1.1248527874\n    b1 \u2248 1.0085743739\n    c1 \u2248 -0.0539054032\n    d1 \u2248 0.2265780322\n\n5) Final inferred model (as of the last step)\n- Using the regression results, the two-second-order ODEs (RHS) that best describe the observed accelerations in dataset 2 are:\n\n  q0'' = (-0.6852550019) * q0 + (0.2032296358) * q1 + (-0.2088563667) * q0' + (-0.0380717670) * q1'\n  q1'' = (-1.1248527874) * q1 + (1.0085743739) * q0 + (-0.0539054032) * q1' + (0.2265780322) * q0'\n\n- In a compact notation:\n  q0'' = a0*q0 + b0*q1 + c0*q0' + d0*q1'\n  q1'' = a1*q1 + b1*q0 + c1*q1' + d1*q0'\n  with the numerical values above.\n\n- The final RHS function (as saved) uses these coefficients to return [q0', q1', q0'', q1''] given the state [q0, q1, q0', q1'].\n\n6) What we learned from the latest results\n- New tool results indicate a primarily linear, damped, cross-coupled two-DOF dynamics with velocity-dependent damping terms:\n  - There are nonzero cross terms (q0\u2013q1 and q1\u2013q0) and velocity terms (q0', q1') that contribute to the accelerations.\n  - The damping terms (c0 and d0 in q0''; c1 and d1 in q1'') are essential to capture the observed decay and energy exchange between the modes.\n- Old hypotheses that fit best after the data:\n  - H2 (linear damped with cross-coupling) is the most plausible baseline, given the presence of q0'', q1'' dependences on both coordinates and both velocities.\n  - H3 (conservative) is not compatible with the data due to the nonzero damping terms inferred from the velocity-dependent components.\n  - Nonlinear terms (Duffing, cubic, etc.) were not required to explain the observed accelerations at the explored amplitudes; however, they could be considered to improve fit at higher amplitudes or for long-term predictive accuracy.\n- New hypotheses worth testing (next steps):\n  -include nonlinear cross-terms (e.g., q0*q1, q0^3, q1^3) to probe any weak nonlinearities at larger amplitudes.\n  -include nonlinear damping (e.g., (q0')^2, (q1')^2) or velocity-squared terms to check if damping becomes amplitude-dependent.\n  -test for weak parametric forcing or slow time variation in parameters to capture any drift between experiments.\n  -validate the model on held-out initial conditions or additional experiments to assess generalizability beyond dataset 2.\n\n7) Final notes and reproducibility\n- The final inferred EOM is a linear, damped, cross-coupled 2-DOF model with coefficients obtained from least-squares fits to dataset 2.\n- The model form and coefficients are explicit, enabling straightforward reproduction or cross-check with new data.\n- The final EOM was saved as an explicit RHS function (with the coefficients embedded) for use in simulations or further analysis.\n\n8) Practical implications and next steps\n- If you want a more robust model, consider:\n  - collecting additional datasets with varied amplitudes and longer times to probe nonlinearity.\n  - performing a joint fit that enforces some physical constraints (e.g., symmetry, energy considerations) to reduce parameter degeneracy.\n  - testing alternative forms (Duffing-type terms, quadratic velocity couplings) to see whether a modest nonlinear correction improves predictive accuracy at larger energies.\n- To proceed, you could:\n  - validate the current linear model against new experiments.\n  - implement the nonlinear terms and re-fit, comparing predictive errors on held-out initial conditions.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can: \n- provide the explicit numerical RHS string suitable for numerical integration (already prepared as mystery_eom_final_rhs),\n- run a quick validation against a fresh set of initial conditions,\n- or set up a small comparison between the linear model and a proposed nonlinear extension (e.g., adding q0^3 and q1^3 terms) to quantify any improvement."}], "past_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "- Act as a computational physicist dedicated to thoroughly resolving the user's query through careful planning, hypothesis generation, and iterative verification.\n- In your first message, create a comprehensive plan to solve the users query.

Experimental plan (5+ experiments to span initial-condition space)\n- We will run 5 parallel evolutions (n_evolutions = 5) with diverse initial conditions to probe linearity, coupling, damping, and nonlinearity:\n  - Exp 1: q0(0)=1.0, q1(0)=0.0, q0dot(0)=0.0, q1dot(0)=0.0\n  - Exp 2: q0(0)=0.0, q1(0)=1.0, q0dot(0)=0.0, q1dot(0)=0.0\n  - Exp 3: q0(0)=1.0, q1(0)=1.0, q0dot(0)=0.0, q1dot(0)=0.0\n  - Exp 4: q0(0)=0.0, q1(0)=0.0, q0dot(0)=1.0, q1dot(0)=0.0\n  - Exp 5: q0(0)=-1.5, q1(0)=0.5, q0dot(0)=0.0, q1dot(0)=0.0\n\n- Data collection: For each evolution, collect time steps t and state vector [q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot] over a reasonably long window to observe damping, coupling exchange, and any nonlinear effects.\n\n- Baseline diagnostics to look for:\n  - If energy decays (damping present) vs. conserved energy (no damping)\n  - Presence of cross-energy transfer indicated by phase shifts and amplitude exchange between q0 and q1\n  - Nonlinear signatures (hardening/softening) via frequency shifts with amplitude\n  - Symmetry between the two coordinates (or lack thereof)\n\nIII. Data handling and visualization\n- Generate plots for each experiment:\n  - q0(t) and q1(t) vs t to inspect coupling and damping\n  - |q0| and |q1| envelopes to see energy exchange\n  - Phase-space plots (q0 vs q0_dot, q1 vs q1_dot) to assess linearity and damping\n  - Spectral content (FFT) to identify dominant frequencies and possible nonlinear harmonics\n\nIV. Model inference strategy\n- Start with the simplest hypothesis (H1/H3) and incrementally add coupling and nonlinearity (H2, H4-H6, etc.), guided by residuals between data and model predictions.\n- Parameter estimation: For each hypothesis, attempt to fit parameters (k0, k1, \u03b30, \u03b31, c, \u03b10, \u03b11, \u03bc, \u03bd, \u03b2, \u03b4, etc.) via least-squares on the observed acceleration data derived from trajectories, or use a black-box optimization on the differential equations to minimize trajectory mismatch.\n- Model selection criteria:\n  - Qualitative fit (does the model reproduce damping, coupling, energy transfer)\n  - Quantitative error (mean-squared error of state trajectories or accelerations)\n  - Parsimony (prefer simpler models if errors comparable)\n  - Predictive ability on held-out initial conditions (if we decide to hold out one initial condition for validation)\n\nV. Next steps after experiments\n- If a candidate EOM class consistently matches across the 5 experiments, refine parameter estimates with more precise optimization and test additional initial conditions (optional additional experiments).\n- If multiple models fit equally well, design targeted experiments to disambiguate (e.g., vary initial energy levels, probe nonlinear response by larger initial displacements).\n\nWhat I will do next\n- Run the 5-trajectory experiment set via the system tool, collect and plot the results, and begin qualitative comparison against the candidate hypotheses. Then I will report what new insights arise, which previous hypotheses remain viable, and what new hypotheses become worth testing. Finally, I will propose a concrete rhs(X, t) form (with estimated parameters) and, per your instruction, run save_result_find_eom to produce the final answer.", "type": "output_text", "logprobs": []}], "role": "assistant", "status": "completed", "type": "message"}, {"arguments": "{\"q0_inits\":\"[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, -1.5]\",\"q1_inits\":\"[0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5]\",\"q0_dot_inits\":\"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]\",\"q1_dot_inits\":\"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\",\"result_label\":\"mystery_eom_experiments\"}", "call_id": "call_eBVG5PZ3bqlzcjWavjrAsWJn", "name": "observe_multiple_evolutions", "type": "function_call", "id": "fc_68d14979abf88193b13657204bbc96c10a24e472b0bee4fe", "status": "completed"}, {"call_id": "call_eBVG5PZ3bqlzcjWavjrAsWJn", "type": "function_call_output", "output": "Saved the following results in the format <result_label>: <result>:\nmystery_eom_experiments_tss: Array of shape (5, 20001) with dtype float32\nmystery_eom_experiments_arrays: Array of shape (5, 20001, 4) with dtype float32"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n You potentially have up to 59 steps left and can call up to 179 tools.

Linear, damped with symmetric cross-coupling:\n  q0'' = -\u03b30 q0' - k0 q0 - c q1\n  q1'' = -\u03b31 q1' - k1 q1 - c q0\n- H3. Linear, conservative with coupling:\n  q0'' = -k0 q0 - c q1\n  q1'' = -k1 q1 - c q0\n- H4. Linear with Duffing-type (cubic) nonlinearities plus coupling:\n  q0'' = -k0 q0 - c q1 - \u03b10 q0^3\n  q1'' = -k1 q1 - c q0 - \u03b11 q1^3\n- H5/H6/H7/H8/H9/H10/etc. Various nonlinear damping, velocity-coupled damping, quadratic/cubic coupling, parametric drives, etc.\n- Takeaway: The family of models ranged from purely linear to moderately nonlinear, with several possible damping and cross-coupling mechanisms.\n\n3) Experimental plan and data collection\n- Five initial-condition experiments were planned per dataset and executed to span the space of initial displacements and velocities, including extreme cases.\n- Datasets:\n  - Mystery_eom_experiments (dataset 1): 5 evolutions with different initial q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot.\n  - Mystery_eom_experiments2 (dataset 2): another 5 evolutions with a different set of initial conditions.\n  - Mystery_eom_experiments3 (dataset 3): a third set of 5 evolutions.\n  - Mystery_eom_experiments4 (dataset 4): a fourth set of 5 evolutions.\n- Observables collected: Time series for q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot at many time steps (about 20001 per evolution in the first two datasets). The data structure for each run was [t, q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot].\n- Visualization: Plots were attempted to inspect q0(t), q1(t), velocities, and phase-space portraits, but some image outputs did not render in the interface (empty/blank images shown in the responses).\n\n4) Data processing and initial model fitting (dataset 2 focus)\n- Idea: Estimate q0'' and q1'' from observed data and regress them onto candidate right-hand sides using q0, q1, q0_dot, q1_dot.\n- Procedure (dataset 2):\n  - Compute accelerations q0'' and q1'' via finite differences of the velocity data (qd0, qd1) using central differences.\n  - Build regression data for q0'': q0'' \u2248 a0*q0 + b0*q1 + c0*q0' + d0*q1'\n  - Build regression data for q1'': q1'' \u2248 a1*q1 + b1*q0 + c1*q1' + d1*q0'\n  - Solve two separate least-squares problems to obtain coefficients.\n- Result (dataset 2):\n  - eq0 coefficients (for q0''):\n    a0 \u2248 -0.6852550019\n    b0 \u2248 0.2032296358\n    c0 \u2248 -0.2088563667\n    d0 \u2248 -0.0380717670\n  - eq1 coefficients (for q1''):\n    a1 \u2248 -1.1248527874\n    b1 \u2248 1.0085743739\n    c1 \u2248 -0.0539054032\n    d1 \u2248 0.2265780322\n\n5) Final inferred model (as of the last step)\n- Using the regression results, the two-second-order ODEs (RHS) that best describe the observed accelerations in dataset 2 are:\n\n  q0'' = (-0.6852550019) * q0 + (0.2032296358) * q1 + (-0.2088563667) * q0' + (-0.0380717670) * q1'\n  q1'' = (-1.1248527874) * q1 + (1.0085743739) * q0 + (-0.0539054032) * q1' + (0.2265780322) * q0'\n\n- In a compact notation:\n  q0'' = a0*q0 + b0*q1 + c0*q0' + d0*q1'\n  q1'' = a1*q1 + b1*q0 + c1*q1' + d1*q0'\n  with the numerical values above.\n\n- The final RHS function (as saved) uses these coefficients to return [q0', q1', q0'', q1''] given the state [q0, q1, q0', q1'].\n\n6) What we learned from the latest results\n- New tool results indicate a primarily linear, damped, cross-coupled two-DOF dynamics with velocity-dependent damping terms:\n  - There are nonzero cross terms (q0\u2013q1 and q1\u2013q0) and velocity terms (q0', q1') that contribute to the accelerations.\n  - The damping terms (c0 and d0 in q0''; c1 and d1 in q1'') are essential to capture the observed decay and energy exchange between the modes.\n- Old hypotheses that fit best after the data:\n  - H2 (linear damped with cross-coupling) is the most plausible baseline, given the presence of q0'', q1'' dependences on both coordinates and both velocities.\n  - H3 (conservative) is not compatible with the data due to the nonzero damping terms inferred from the velocity-dependent components.\n  - Nonlinear terms (Duffing, cubic, etc.) were not required to explain the observed accelerations at the explored amplitudes; however, they could be considered to improve fit at higher amplitudes or for long-term predictive accuracy.\n- New hypotheses worth testing (next steps):\n  -include nonlinear cross-terms (e.g., q0*q1, q0^3, q1^3) to probe any weak nonlinearities at larger amplitudes.\n  -include nonlinear damping (e.g., (q0')^2, (q1')^2) or velocity-squared terms to check if damping becomes amplitude-dependent.\n  -test for weak parametric forcing or slow time variation in parameters to capture any drift between experiments.\n  -validate the model on held-out initial conditions or additional experiments to assess generalizability beyond dataset 2.\n\n7) Final notes and reproducibility\n- The final inferred EOM is a linear, damped, cross-coupled 2-DOF model with coefficients obtained from least-squares fits to dataset 2.\n- The model form and coefficients are explicit, enabling straightforward reproduction or cross-check with new data.\n- The final EOM was saved as an explicit RHS function (with the coefficients embedded) for use in simulations or further analysis.\n\n8) Practical implications and next steps\n- If you want a more robust model, consider:\n  - collecting additional datasets with varied amplitudes and longer times to probe nonlinearity.\n  - performing a joint fit that enforces some physical constraints (e.g., symmetry, energy considerations) to reduce parameter degeneracy.\n  - testing alternative forms (Duffing-type terms, quadratic velocity couplings) to see whether a modest nonlinear correction improves predictive accuracy at larger energies.\n- To proceed, you could:\n  - validate the current linear model against new experiments.\n  - implement the nonlinear terms and re-fit, comparing predictive errors on held-out initial conditions.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can: \n- provide the explicit numerical RHS string suitable for numerical integration (already prepared as mystery_eom_final_rhs),\n- run a quick validation against a fresh set of initial conditions,\n- or set up a small comparison between the linear model and a proposed nonlinear extension (e.g., adding q0^3 and q1^3 terms) to quantify any improvement.", "type": "output_text", "logprobs": []}], "role": "assistant", "status": "completed", "type": "message"}], "result": {"R2": NaN, "R2_list": [], "predicted_rhs": "def rhs(X:jax.Array, t:float) -> jax.Array:\\n    import jax.numpy as jnp\\n    q0, q1, q0d, q1d = X[0], X[1], X[2], X[3]\\n    a0 = -0.6852550019470568\\n    b0 = 0.20322963576617162\\n    c0 = -0.20885636666101748\\n    d0 = -0.03807176703495976\\n    a1 = -1.1248527874165062\\n    b1 = 1.0085743739128885\\n    c1 = -0.05390540322603019\\n    d1 = 0.22657803215153668\\n    q0dd = a0*q0 + b0*q1 + c0*q0d + d0*q1d\\n    q1dd = a1*q1 + b1*q0 + c1*q1d + d1*q0d\\n    return jnp.array([q0d, q1d, q0dd, q1dd])", "error": "'predicted_rhs'"}, "runtime": 838.7667117118835, "timestamp": "2025-09-22 15:17:34.245614", "input_hash": "ed8ad81add45856f37f5e722d47f09cf076040a0a16147c42b0a4d0b10afda19"}
